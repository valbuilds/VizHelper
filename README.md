# VizHelper

**This is a fork of [playsamay4's VizHelper](https://github.com/playsamay4/VizHelper).**

I've remade the program from scratch with Python using [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and [pyimgui](https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui) instead of Lua using [LÃ–VE](https://github.com/love2d/love) and [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui).

## installation

### pre-built

See the [Releases](https://github.com/valbuilds/VizHelper/releases) tab.
